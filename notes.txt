To-DO 
-------
#10 Readme file
#11 Clean up code with comments and format (try prettier extension?)
#12 Update GitHub page with proper info (tags, description, etc.)
#13 Make a thanks for playing banner for results screen 
#14 re-organize images into a site assets sub-folder within images
#15 Have option on cards page to set the # of qoutes per game?

Today 

- Cards remain same height regardless of screen size

- ** Look in to tablet keyboard support and dark mode detection **
 - Dark mode: text on cards has a visibility issue. 

- Breakpoint for smaller screens test

- Test if space button is causing screen movement issue on main.html when typing.  

- Move cards.html btn listener to seperate JS file and import if needed
 - If this is done the btn value will need to be stored into a var and imported to be used in logic.js

- Add 10 qoute limit to qoutes if more are added


Notes 

- for homepage re-add no scroll y || try overflow hidden again
