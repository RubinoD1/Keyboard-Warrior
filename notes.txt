Today 

- Make homepage index.html and have cards on a seperate page 
  - change start btn event listener to load cards.html || 
    change btn to a link to page and remove start btn from listener. 
  -Homepage CSS: make btn centered height wise and increase btn size

- console error on results screen if input pressed. 
 - issue is qoutes left: - / - trying to be changed by line 36(currently):
   //Update qoutes left HTML
   document.getElementById("qoutes-left").innerHTML = "Quotes left: " + arrayPosition + " / " + theme.length; 

- Replay button is currently reloading the page back to the start screen. 
  - Change to load to card selection, or re-work homepage?  

- Instead of hidding divs: remove them and see if this cleans up the white space. 
  - Alternative: make the divs in JS instead of having them hidden by default. 
    - need to stop scroll bar and hide white spaces at bottom. 

- Change start button into difficulty select buttons?

- ADD actual qoutes to array.

- Add on hover for homepage start button color change 

- Breakpoint for smaller screens added that removes no scroll
