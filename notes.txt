Today 

- End game working 
  - replay button working 

- Instead of hidding divs: remove them and see if this cleans up the white space. 
  - Alternative: make the divs in JS instead of having them hidden by default. 
    - need to stop scroll bar and hide white spaces at bottom. 

- Change start button into difficulty select buttons?

- ADD actual qoutes to array.
