Today 

- SPAN DOES NOT REPLACE A STRING IT MODIFIES IT --- NEED TO CREATE A NEW STRING WITH APPLIED CHANGES???
  - modify string with style change 
  - return new string replacing the old. 


- Add a span element to each character of a srtring including spaces 
  THEN add classes to modify colour of text.


NOTES
--------
- logo 460 x 120 (Bulma default logo)

- Progress bar for quotes left: 
  - will need to manipulate the value of progress bar to update progress (JS). 
  - remeber to set default value to 0 in the HTML file when testing is done. 

- Quote input checker 
  - input matches current character: 
     - Make text character green
     - Move text position indicator to next character
     - Update typing accuracy %
     - 
  - input does not match cuurent character:
    - Make text character red

- Qoute current location marker
 - Increase the font size, make character bold and have a border around location (black spaces will need to be marked somehow). 





Iteration for assigning id's to each character in string 
------
Goal take a array.value 
iterate through the string (make sure spaces get assigned) and make each character a child of a parent div
  - each child element will be assigned a unique id so they can be assigned a class that will modify the text color 
  - MAKE SURE that by making each character a seperate child the quote is not formatted wrong. 




Sample 1:
if (i < array[0].textContent.length){ //check if textContent.length works for array strings
   //create a child element within the HTML div that will act as a parent
   //the child will be assigned an id "character0" and will be modified later with assigning
    a specific class that will change the font color to that id based on user input.


         //array[0].textContent.charAt(0) 
   
}
