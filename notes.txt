- Test if space button is causing screen movement issue on main.html when typing.  
  - TRY removing header and see if issue persists
  - Also, Google preventing space key from adjusting screen position. 
  - Firefox opening search with space key press preventing typing 

- Cards remain same height regardless of screen size

- ** Look in to tablet keyboard support and dark mode detection **
 - Dark mode: text on cards has a visibility issue. 

- Breakpoint for smaller screens test


- Re-add header to results screen and figure out how to prevent search bar from opening in browsers. 
 - preferably re-add header to main.html and prevent space bar from moving page.
