## What is Keybaord Warrior?

Keyboard Warrior is a JavaScript built typing app. It cointains 12 selectable themes, each with a set of 10 randomized quotes. The themes are mainly centered around literature, philosophy, and historical figures. 

An accuracy percentage is scored per quote with a total percentage being given at the completion of the tenth quote.  

<b>
Keyboard Warrior does not have virtual keyboard support implemented. The app was built with a focus on inputs from a physical keyboard.
